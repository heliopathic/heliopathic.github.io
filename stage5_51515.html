            <span>Okay lets talk about this guy. Honestly speaking even this guy doesn't know why tf you are fangirling him.
                I mean, he sucks at what he does. I have tried telling you this a lottt. He is the typical Shikhari Shambu(chakka muyal thing).
                On one such occasion he has openly admitted he blindly see-saw(ed) and somehow all went well.
                I'm pretty sure you have laughed like hell watching that! Use the hint only if you really need to!</span>
